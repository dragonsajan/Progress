Apart from any kinds of ProgresHUDs that capture the whole screen and lock the user interaction, Progress provides a more precise and elegant progress indicator. Progress allows you to add any number/kinds of progressor views into each view with only one line of code. The progress indicator can be an arbitrary combination of built-in/custom progressors. Progress helps you provide a fluent user experience in your iOS application.
